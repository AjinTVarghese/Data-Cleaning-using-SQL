This SQL project focuses on comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, utilizing advanced SQL querying techniques to transform raw data into a structured and actionable format.

## Skills Demonstrated:

- Data Modification: ALTER, DROP, UPDATE
- Conditional Logic: CASE (WHEN, ELSE)
- Data Aggregation: COUNT
- String Manipulation: PARSENAME, REPLACE, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX
- Data Type Conversion: CONVERT
- Data Joining: JOIN
- Null Handling: ISNULL
- Temporary Result Sets: CTE

## Data Cleaning Tasks:

- Standardized date format for consistency.
- Populated property address data.
- Broken out address into individual columns (address, city, state).
- Transformed 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in "Sold as Vacant" field.
